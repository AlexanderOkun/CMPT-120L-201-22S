### Thought Process / Comments
This type of documentation for coding is simply something I used to do in HTML so it's quite familiar to me. Although its a little bit different, I honeslty like doing it this way better. In my opinion, using Markdown makes the text look much cleaner without having to deal with all of the syntax of HTML for example. Markdown is something I am going to use more often on my personal projects.
